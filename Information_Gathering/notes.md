Pillaging

## Passive:
| Technique | Description | Example | Tools | Risk of Detection |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Port Scanning | Identifying open ports and services running on the target. | Using Nmap to scan a web server for open ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). | Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan | High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls. |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations. | Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. | Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto | High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect. |
| Network Mapping | Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships. | Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure. | Traceroute, Nmap | Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion. |
| Banner Grabbing | Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target. | Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version. | Netcat, curl | Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged. |
| OS Fingerprinting | Identifying the operating system running on the target. | Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (-O) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS. | Nmap, Xprobe2 | Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected. |
| Service Enumeration | Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports. | Using Nmap's service version detection (-sV) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0. | Nmap | Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts. |
| Web Spidering | Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files. | Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources. | Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy (customisable) | Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic. |
